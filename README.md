Sprint Review and Retrospective – Final Project Submission

This repository includes my Sprint Review and Retrospective from the CS 250 final project. This document highlights how I applied Agile and Scrum practices throughout the course, reflecting on teamwork, iteration, and continuous improvement.

Reflection

1.) How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

Interpreting user needs starts with really understanding what the end user is trying to accomplish, not just what they say they want. Creating user stories helped me a lot because it forced me to think from the user’s perspective. Instead of focusing only on technical tasks, user stories kept me aligned with the actual value the user expects. It made it easier to break down features into manageable pieces while always keeping the bigger goal in mind.

2.) How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

I’ve learned that I work best when I take an iterative approach, focusing on small, incremental progress instead of trying to perfect everything in one shot. Agile processes like sprints, regular reviews, and retrospectives helped me stay organized and adaptable. Moving forward, I want to keep using techniques like backlog management, daily stand-ups (even if informal), and continuous feedback to improve both my workflow and the final product.

3.)What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

Being a good team member isn’t just about writing solid code. It’s about communication, being open to feedback, and supporting your teammates when challenges come up. I realized that keeping everyone on the same page and being flexible when priorities shift is just as important as technical skills. A good team member helps create an environment where collaboration leads to better solutions than anyone could come up with alone.
